Meanbee SmartAddress Postcode Anywhere Extension
=====================
Building on the success of the Meanbee_Postcode module for Magento, we are pleased to announce the arrival of MeanbeeSmartAddress. It is an international version of MeanbeePostcode, created once again with the help of our friends from PostcodeAnywhere.co.uk. Meanbee_SmartAddress can auto-complete international addresses for your customers at the Magento checkout and also when creating orders in Magento Admin.

Using the UK, US and International address completion module to auto-complete addresses benefits both you and your customers

- Save time and money
- Increase Data Accuracy
- Reduce Cart Abandonment
- Avoid the cost of missed deliveries
- Improve Customer Service

UK and US address lookups are completed to a building level and use 1 credit. International lookups are completed to a street level and use 2 credits. Countries supported include North America, Europe, Australasia and parts of Asia.

Please note that you will need to purchase credits from [PostcodeAnywhere.co.uk](PostcodeAnywhere.co.uk) in order to use this module successfully. Their prices start from 50GBP for 1000 credits. Click [here](PostcodeAnywhere.co.uk) to find out more.

#### Customised Checkouts

We provide instructions on how to integrate the module into the standard Magento OnePage Checkout. It’s almost certainly possible to integrate the module into any other Magento Checkouts, but we do not support nor provide instructions for doing so. Don’t worry, it shouldn’t take a decent Magento developer much time at all.

#### Setup

The module asks for two settings, "Account Key" and "License Key". The first is your account login to PostcodeAnywhere. The second is a web service key that you can set up in the Manage Keys section of your PostcodeAnywhere customer account.

##### Compatibility
Compatibility: 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9
